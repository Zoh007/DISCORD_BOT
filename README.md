# DISCORD_BOT
I have made a discord bot.

FIRST of all, if you guys don't have the discord module downloaded, please use the following command to do it:

    pip install discord.py

After that, if the code shows the following error,

No module named 'discord', line 1, in <module>
    import discord
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'discord',

Go to the interpretor and locate where you downloaded the discord.py file.

After that, copy the path and change the interpretor and you are all good to go.
